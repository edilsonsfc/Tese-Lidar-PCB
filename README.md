## Introduction
My master's thesis, titled "Three-dimensional mapping of an unknown environment based on a 2D laser measurement" explores the development of a low-cost 3D mapping system capable of generating a point cloud of an indoor environment and performing path planning. The work presented in this repository supports the findings and experiments conducted during the research process.
